<p>The source and a variety of binaries of the tools are available free of charge on the
<a href="https://community.informatica.com/solutions/1470" target="_top">Informatica
Marketplace</a>. After expanding the files, the appropriate binary then can be invoked
from a command shell with the "-h" option to get a help screen. The binary directory also
contains a script that was used to build the binaries.</p>

<br />
<p>The tools, <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> in particular, have many options which are
useful in diagnosing a variety of multicast problems. To make the initial evaluation of
the network easy, the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> command has 5 numbered command-line
options (<code class="PARAMETER">-1</code> through <code class="PARAMETER">-5</code>)
which pre-load other options to values which test for the most common network
problems.</p>

<p>Both the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> and <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> commands
take zero or more Unix-style options, followed by two required positional parameters:
multicast address (group), and destination port. In the examples listed in this document,
addresses and ports are used by default by Informatica's <b class="APPLICATION">UMS</b>
product (formerly called "LBM"), but any addresses and ports can be used. However, for
each step in the initial 5-step test, it is important to use <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">different</i></span> multicast addresses for each step. In fact, if you
desire to run a particular test a second time, it is a good idea to chose a multicast
address that is different from the previous run of the same test. (This is because the
tests are verifying different ways that a multicast stream is initiated, so re-running a
test on a multicast address that the switch and router is already initialized for will
prevent the test from verifying the stream initiation condition.)</p>

<p>The <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> command has an optional third positional parameter
which is the TTL (Time To Live) for the sent packets. This field controls how widely the
multicast datagrams can be distributed in an interconnected group of networks. A TTL of 1
prevents the datagram from crossing any routers, restricting the datagrams to a single
network segment (LAN). However, many switches and routers actually operate <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">less</i></span> efficiently with a TTL of 1, so the
tool defaults to a TTL of 2. It is assumed that you want to verify the performance of
your routers, so the examples below use a TTL of 2. For some organizations, multiple
routers may need to be crossed, which would require the TTL to be increased.</p>

<p>The <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> command has an optional forth positional parameter
which is the IP address of the desired network interface. The <tt
class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> command also can specify a network interface as its third
positional parameter. This parameter is only needed on a multi-homed host (machine with
more than one network interface). With normal unicast destination addresses, IP uses
routing tables to determine the correct interface to send packets. With multicast, there
is no "correct" interface - the application should specify which interface to use. (It is
possible for an application to let the operating system choose an interface, but this can
lead to systems that work properly for a time, and then mysteriously stop working due to
minor hardware or operating system upgrades. It is a much better idea to specify the
correct interface for your network architecture.) In the examples below, it is assumed
that the sending and receiving hosts are single-homed, and therefore do not require the
interface.</p>

<p>The <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> command attempts to set its socket to have a 4 MB
UDP receive buffer. Many operating systems will not grant a request that large (the tool
will inform you how large a buffer it was able to get). However, if your sending machine
is a reasonably high-power machine, the receiver may very well need a large receive
buffer. You can use the "netstat" command (usually with the "-s" option) to see UDP
statistics, including packets dropped due to the receive buffer overflowing. If you
consistently get loss with tests 3 - 5, it may be necessary to have your system
administrator increase the maximum allowable receive buffer (it's a kernel tuning
parameter). See our <a
href="http://www.29west.com/docs/THPM/thpm.html#SETTING-KERNEL-UDP-BUFFER-LIMITS"
target="_top">THPM document</a> for advice in this area.</p>

<p>The <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> command attempts to set its socket to have a 64 KB
UDP send buffer. Many operating systems will not grant a request that large (the tool
will inform you how large a buffer it was able to get). However, we have found that
especially when sending fairly large datagrams, less than 64 KB of send buffer prevents
the sending machine from reaching its maximum send rate. In fact, if your sending
datagrams are themselves approaching 64 KB in size, you may need an even larger send
buffer, perhaps three times the maximum datagram size. However, due to a possible bug in
Linux, you should not set your send socket buffer more than 192 KB (196608).</p>

<p>Finally, it is very possible to experience loss due to a sufficiently-large capability
mismatch between the sending and receiving machines. It might be because the sending
machine has a faster network interface than the receiving machine, or a faster CPU, or an
operating system that is more efficient at processing UDP. For the purposes of evaluating
your network, it is suggested that the sending and receiving machines be as
closely-matched as possible.</p>
