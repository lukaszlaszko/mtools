<p>Many organizations are looking to switch their high-speed messaging from TCP to
Multicast. This can drastically improve their performance in streaming data applications,
such as live market data, where you have many subscriber programs. However, many
corporate network infrastructures provide limited multicast connectivity or are not able
to sustain high message rates. Even sites that are successfully using multicast with
legacy messaging systems encounter problems after an upgrade to a higher-performing
messaging layer.</p>

<p>Fortunately, most modern networking hardware is capable of passing wire-speed
multicast with appropriate configuration parameters. The key is discovering configuration
problems early and diagnosing them. The "msend", "mdump", and "mpong" tools can help. We
at Informatica invite you to use them to evaluate your network's capacity to carry
multicast traffic.</p>

<div class="WARNING">
<blockquote class="WARNING">
<p><b>Warning</b>: If used carelessly, the msend tool can produce significant network
loading and congestion, to the point of rendering switches and routers virtually
non-functional. When using large burst counts (-b&gt;500) and/or small pause times
(-p&lt;100), make sure to keep the number of bursts (-n) small enough to limit the
duration of the test to a few seconds.</p>

<br />
<br />
<p>The tools, <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> in particular, have many options which are
useful in diagnosing a variety of multicast problems. To make the initial evaluation of
the network easy, the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> command has 5 numbered command-line
options (<code class="PARAMETER">-1</code> through <code class="PARAMETER">-5</code>)
which pre-load other options to values which test for the most common network
problems.</p>

<p>Both the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> and <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> commands
take zero or more Unix-style options, followed by two required positional parameters:
multicast address (group), and destination port. In the examples listed in this document,
addresses and ports are used by default by Informatica's <b class="APPLICATION">UMS</b>
product (formerly called "LBM"), but any addresses and ports can be used. However, for
each step in the initial 5-step test, it is important to use <span class="emphasis"><i
class="EMPHASIS">different</i></span> multicast addresses for each step. In fact, if you
desire to run a particular test a second time, it is a good idea to chose a multicast
address that is different from the previous run of the same test. (This is because the
tests are verifying different ways that a multicast stream is initiated, so re-running a
test on a multicast address that the switch and router is already initialized for will
prevent the test from verifying the stream initiation condition.)</p>

<p>The <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> command has an optional third positional parameter
which is the TTL (Time To Live) for the sent packets. This field controls how widely the
multicast datagrams can be distributed in an interconnected group of networks. A TTL of 1
prevents the datagram from crossing any routers, restricting the datagrams to a single
network segment (LAN). However, many switches and routers actually operate <span
class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">less</i></span> efficiently with a TTL of 1, so the
tool defaults to a TTL of 2. It is assumed that you want to verify the performance of
your routers, so the examples below use a TTL of 2. For some organizations, multiple
routers may need to be crossed, which would require the TTL to be increased.</p>

<p>The <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> command has an optional forth positional parameter
which is the IP address of the desired network interface. The <tt
class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> command also can specify a network interface as its third
positional parameter. This parameter is only needed on a multi-homed host (machine with
more than one network interface). With normal unicast destination addresses, IP uses
routing tables to determine the correct interface to send packets. With multicast, there
is no "correct" interface - the application should specify which interface to use. (It is
possible for an application to let the operating system choose an interface, but this can
lead to systems that work properly for a time, and then mysteriously stop working due to
minor hardware or operating system upgrades. It is a much better idea to specify the
correct interface for your network architecture.) In the examples below, it is assumed
that the sending and receiving hosts are single-homed, and therefore do not require the
interface.</p>

<p>The <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> command attempts to set its socket to have a 4 MB
UDP receive buffer. Many operating systems will not grant a request that large (the tool
will inform you how large a buffer it was able to get). However, if your sending machine
is a reasonably high-power machine, the receiver may very well need a large receive
buffer. You can use the "netstat" command (usually with the "-s" option) to see UDP
statistics, including packets dropped due to the receive buffer overflowing. If you
consistently get loss with tests 3 - 5, it may be necessary to have your system
administrator increase the maximum allowable receive buffer (it's a kernel tuning
parameter). See our <a
href="http://www.29west.com/docs/THPM/thpm.html#SETTING-KERNEL-UDP-BUFFER-LIMITS"
target="_top">THPM document</a> for advice in this area.</p>

<p>The <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt> command attempts to set its socket to have a 64 KB
UDP send buffer. Many operating systems will not grant a request that large (the tool
will inform you how large a buffer it was able to get). However, we have found that
especially when sending fairly large datagrams, less than 64 KB of send buffer prevents
the sending machine from reaching its maximum send rate. In fact, if your sending
datagrams are themselves approaching 64 KB in size, you may need an even larger send
buffer, perhaps three times the maximum datagram size. However, due to a possible bug in
Linux, you should not set your send socket buffer more than 192 KB (196608).</p>

<p>Finally, it is very possible to experience loss due to a sufficiently-large capability
mismatch between the sending and receiving machines. It might be because the sending
machine has a faster network interface than the receiving machine, or a faster CPU, or an
operating system that is more efficient at processing UDP. For the purposes of evaluating
your network, it is suggested that the sending and receiving machines be as
closely-matched as possible.</p>

Tests</a></h2>

<div class="SECTION">
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="TEST-1" name="TEST-1">3.1. Test 1</a></h3>

<p>Test 1 sends one small datagram per second for 10 minutes. It initially tests simple
connectivity, and after several minutes verifies that multicast streams are properly
maintained over several IGMP query timeouts. Start the <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt>
first, then after a second or two start the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt>.</p>

<p>Receiving Host:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
mdump -omdump1.log 224.9.10.11 12965 10.1.2.3
</pre>

Sending Host:

<pre class="SCREEN">
msend -1 224.9.10.11 12965 15 10.1.2.4
</pre>

(Note: host interface addresses 10.1.2.* should be changed to reflect your hosts.) This
test will run for 10 minutes and then report the percentage of dropped messages
(datagrams). During that time, <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> will display the received
messages in a hex dump form. At the end of the test run, <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt>
will tell <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> to display statistics. You should use <tt
class="COMMAND">ctrl-C</tt> to exit <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> when test 1
finishes.<br />
<br />
<p>Be sure to run the test a second time, switching the roles of sender and receiver, and
remember to use a different multicast address for that second run. Also, note that other
tests use the "-q" option on the mdump command. However, test 1 does not use "-q".</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="TEST-2" name="TEST-2">3.2. Test 2</a></h3>

<p>Test 2 sends one large datagram per second for 5 seconds. It tests the ability of the
network hardware to establish a multicast stream from a fragmented datagram. Start the
<tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> first, then after a second or two start the <tt
class="COMMAND">msend</tt>.</p>

<p>Receiving Host:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
mdump -q -omdump2.log 224.10.10.10 14400 10.1.2.3
</pre>

Sending Host:

<pre class="SCREEN">
msend -2 224.10.10.10 14400 15 10.1.2.4
</pre>

(Note: host interface addresses 10.1.2.* should be changed to reflect your hosts.) Notice
that this and subsequent <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> commands include the "-q" option
to prevent the hex dump of each datagram. In this test it is for convenience; in future
tests it is necessary to prevent slow receiver operation.<br />
<br />
<p>Be sure to run the test a second time, switching the roles of sender and receiver, and
remember to use a different multicast address for that second run.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="TEST-3" name="TEST-3">3.3. Test 3</a></h3>

<p>Test 3 sends 50 bursts of 100 datagrams (8K each). Each burst of 100 is sent at the
maximum possible send rate for the machine usually fully saturating the wire), and the
bursts are separated by a tenth of a second. This is a pretty heavy load that tests the
ability of the network hardware to establish a wire-speed multicast stream from a
fragmented datagram. Start the <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> first, then after a second
or two start the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt>.</p>

<p>Receiving Host:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
mdump -q -omdump3.log 224.10.10.14 14400 10.1.2.3
</pre>

Sending Host:

<pre class="SCREEN">
msend -3 224.10.10.14 14400 14 10.1.2.4
</pre>

(Note: host interface addresses 10.1.2.* should be changed to reflect your hosts.)
Depending on the speed of the machine, this test should not run much longer than 7
seconds, usually much shorter.<br />
<br />
<p>Be sure to run the test a second time, switching the roles of sender and receiver, and
remember to use a different multicast address for that second run.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="TEST-4" name="TEST-4">3.4. Test 4</a></h3>

<p>Test 4 sends a single burst of 5000 datagrams (20 bytes each). The burst is sent at
the maximum possible send rate for the machine. It may not fully saturate the wire, but
does lead to a very high message rate during the burst. This is a another heavy load that
tests the ability of the network hardware to sustain a high message rate multicast
stream. Start the <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> first, then after a second or two start
the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt>.</p>

<p>Receiving Host:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
mdump -q -omdump4.log 224.10.10.18 14400 10.1.2.3
</pre>

Sending Host:

<pre class="SCREEN">
msend -4 224.10.10.18 14400 15 10.1.2.4
</pre>

(Note: host interface addresses 10.1.2.* should be changed to reflect your hosts.)
Depending on the speed of the sending machine, this test should not run much more than 5
seconds, often much less.<br />
<br />
<p>Be sure to run the test a second time, switching the roles of sender and receiver, and
remember to use a different multicast address for that second run.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<hr />
<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="TEST-5" name="TEST-5">3.5. Test 5</a></h3>

<p>Test 5 sends a single burst of 50,000 datagrams (800 bytes each). The burst is sent at
the maximum possible send rate for the machine. This test generates the heaviest load of
the 5 tests, and should saturate a 1-gig link. Start the <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt>
first, then after a second or two start the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt>.</p>

<p>Receiving Host:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
mdump -q -omdump5.log 224.10.10.18 14400 10.1.2.3
</pre>

Sending Host:

<pre class="SCREEN">
msend -5 224.10.10.18 14400 15 10.1.2.4
</pre>

(Note: host interface addresses 10.1.2.* should be changed to reflect your hosts.)
Depending on the speed of the sending machine, this test should not run much more than 5
seconds, often much less.<br />
<br />
<p>If this test experiences loss, re-run the msend command with the option "-S65536". If
this option removes the loss, then your system default UDP send buffer size is too large.
Many Linux systems suffer from this if the UDP send buffer is larger than a few hundred
KB. We recommend setting the default to either three times your maximum datagram size, or
64 KB, whichever is larger. If that is not desirable, then we recommend configuring your
multicast applications to override the system default UDP send buffer size.</p>

<p>It is a good idea during the execution of this test for the network hardware
administration team to monitor switch CPU usage. We have seen cases where switches that
handle multicast in hardware still overload the switch CPU when high-rate multicast is
used. For example, we saw one user of Cisco hardware enable an ACL, with the result that
the CPU had to examine each multicast packet. This left his Cisco switch at 90% CPU
utilization even though he was only using about half of the gigabit bandwidth. It is
always better to discover this kind of CPU loading early, rather than on the "go-live"
day.</p>

<p>Be sure to run the test a second time, switching the roles of sender and receiver, and
remember to use a different multicast address for that second run.</p>

<h3 class="SECTION"><a id="NEXT-STEPS" name="NEXT-STEPS">3.6. Next Steps</a></h3>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this simple document to attempt to fully diagnose and
describe the treatments of various multicast networking maladies. Networking routers and
switches are too diverse. However, you can find a wealth of general information in our <a
href="http://www.29west.com/docs/THPM/thpm.html#SETTING-KERNEL-UDP-BUFFER-LIMITS"
target="_top">THPM document</a>. If you suspect that your network infrastructure is not
able to handle high-speed multicast traffic, there is a very good chance that it is
simply a matter of switch and router configuration. We have found that network
administrators, working with the network hardware's support team, are usually successful
at enabling the proper hardware multicast routing parameters. It sometimes requires a bit
of patience and digging, but the scaling advantages of multicast are well worth the
effort.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<hr />
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="MPONG" name="MPONG">4. Mpong</a></h2>

<p>The <tt class="COMMAND">mpong</tt> commad can be used to get a very rough idea of the
round-trip latency between two machines. However, be aware that this tool does not
contain optimizations which could further decrease latencies; for example, it does not
set CPU affinity or modify thread priority. It also does not contain logic to detect lost
packets and retransmit them. Nor does it provide topic-based PUB/SUB model of usage.</p>

<p>However, the tool can still be useful in reproducing latency problems with a simple
tool which can be provided in source form to support organizations for diagnosis. For
example:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
MACHINE 1: mpong 224.1.3.5 12000

MACHINE 2: mpong -iv -ompong.raw 224.1.3.5 12000
</pre>

Machine 2, the initiator (<tt class="COMMAND">-i</tt>) will start the test by sending a
packet to Machine 1, the reflector, over group 224.1.3.5 port 12001. The packet will
contain the sending timestamp. Machine 1 will receive it and send it back (reflect) over
the same group but with port 12000. This is one round-trip cycle. The first 20 cycles are
for "warm-up", followed by the measurement phase, consisting of 65536 (default) cycles.
The initiator prints the results and exits. The reflector does not exit and must be
killed.<br />
<br />
<p>Notice that both commands are provided port number 12000; the code takes care of
incrementing it appropriately. The <tt class="COMMAND">-v</tt> option forces verbose
output, resulting in a large dataset being written to file <tt
class="COMMAND">plot.raw</tt>.</p>

<div class="WARNING">
<blockquote class="WARNING">
<p><b>Warning</b>: Since this tool's multicast traffic is UDP, it is possible to lose a
packet during the test. This will result in a hang of the test since no timeouts are
programmed. If several tries continue to result in loss, there is something seriously
wrong with your multicast connectivity, and that needs to be diagnosed and resolved
before meaningful latency measurements are possible. You should use the <a
href="#INITIAL-FIVE">initial 5 tests</a> to verify adequate connectivity before using
mpong.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>A quick and easy plot of the data can produced with <a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/"
target="_top">gnuplot</a>. Here is a simple unix shell script:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
