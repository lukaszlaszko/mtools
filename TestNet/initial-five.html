Tests</a></h1>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TEST-1" name="TEST-1">3.1. Test 1</a></h2>

<p>Test 1 sends one small datagram per second for 10 minutes. It initially tests simple
connectivity, and after several minutes verifies that multicast streams are properly
maintained over several IGMP query timeouts. Start the <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt>
first, then after a second or two start the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt>.</p>

<p>Receiving Host:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
mdump -omdump1.log 224.9.10.11 12965 10.1.2.3
</pre>

Sending Host:

<pre class="SCREEN">
msend -1 224.9.10.11 12965 15 10.1.2.4
</pre>

(Note: host interface addresses 10.1.2.* should be changed to reflect your hosts.) This
test will run for 10 minutes and then report the percentage of dropped messages
(datagrams). During that time, <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> will display the received
messages in a hex dump form. At the end of the test run, <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt>
will tell <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> to display statistics. You should use <tt
class="COMMAND">ctrl-C</tt> to exit <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> when test 1
finishes.<br />
<br />
<p>Be sure to run the test a second time, switching the roles of sender and receiver, and
remember to use a different multicast address for that second run. Also, note that other
tests use the "-q" option on the mdump command. However, test 1 does not use "-q".</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TEST-2" name="TEST-2">3.2. Test 2</a></h2>

<p>Test 2 sends one large datagram per second for 5 seconds. It tests the ability of the
network hardware to establish a multicast stream from a fragmented datagram. Start the
<tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> first, then after a second or two start the <tt
class="COMMAND">msend</tt>.</p>

<p>Receiving Host:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
mdump -q -omdump2.log 224.10.10.10 14400 10.1.2.3
</pre>

Sending Host:

<pre class="SCREEN">
msend -2 224.10.10.10 14400 15 10.1.2.4
</pre>

(Note: host interface addresses 10.1.2.* should be changed to reflect your hosts.) Notice
that this and subsequent <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> commands include the "-q" option
to prevent the hex dump of each datagram. In this test it is for convenience; in future
tests it is necessary to prevent slow receiver operation.<br />
<br />
<p>Be sure to run the test a second time, switching the roles of sender and receiver, and
remember to use a different multicast address for that second run.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TEST-3" name="TEST-3">3.3. Test 3</a></h2>

<p>Test 3 sends 50 bursts of 100 datagrams (8K each). Each burst of 100 is sent at the
maximum possible send rate for the machine usually fully saturating the wire), and the
bursts are separated by a tenth of a second. This is a pretty heavy load that tests the
ability of the network hardware to establish a wire-speed multicast stream from a
fragmented datagram. Start the <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> first, then after a second
or two start the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt>.</p>

<p>Receiving Host:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
mdump -q -omdump3.log 224.10.10.14 14400 10.1.2.3
</pre>

Sending Host:

<pre class="SCREEN">
msend -3 224.10.10.14 14400 14 10.1.2.4
</pre>

(Note: host interface addresses 10.1.2.* should be changed to reflect your hosts.)
Depending on the speed of the machine, this test should not run much longer than 7
seconds, usually much shorter.<br />
<br />
<p>Be sure to run the test a second time, switching the roles of sender and receiver, and
remember to use a different multicast address for that second run.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TEST-4" name="TEST-4">3.4. Test 4</a></h2>

<p>Test 4 sends a single burst of 5000 datagrams (20 bytes each). The burst is sent at
the maximum possible send rate for the machine. It may not fully saturate the wire, but
does lead to a very high message rate during the burst. This is a another heavy load that
tests the ability of the network hardware to sustain a high message rate multicast
stream. Start the <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt> first, then after a second or two start
the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt>.</p>

<p>Receiving Host:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
mdump -q -omdump4.log 224.10.10.18 14400 10.1.2.3
</pre>

Sending Host:

<pre class="SCREEN">
msend -4 224.10.10.18 14400 15 10.1.2.4
</pre>

(Note: host interface addresses 10.1.2.* should be changed to reflect your hosts.)
Depending on the speed of the sending machine, this test should not run much more than 5
seconds, often much less.<br />
<br />
<p>Be sure to run the test a second time, switching the roles of sender and receiver, and
remember to use a different multicast address for that second run.</p>
</div>

<div class="SECTION">
<h2 class="SECTION"><a id="TEST-5" name="TEST-5">3.5. Test 5</a></h2>

<p>Test 5 sends a single burst of 50,000 datagrams (800 bytes each). The burst is sent at
the maximum possible send rate for the machine. This test generates the heaviest load of
the 5 tests, and should saturate a 1-gig link. Start the <tt class="COMMAND">mdump</tt>
first, then after a second or two start the <tt class="COMMAND">msend</tt>.</p>

<p>Receiving Host:</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
mdump -q -omdump5.log 224.10.10.18 14400 10.1.2.3
</pre>

Sending Host:

<pre class="SCREEN">
msend -5 224.10.10.18 14400 15 10.1.2.4
</pre>

(Note: host interface addresses 10.1.2.* should be changed to reflect your hosts.)
Depending on the speed of the sending machine, this test should not run much more than 5
seconds, often much less.<br />
<br />
<p>If this test experiences loss, re-run the msend command with the option "-S65536". If
this option removes the loss, then your system default UDP send buffer size is too large.
Many Linux systems suffer from this if the UDP send buffer is larger than a few hundred
KB. We recommend setting the default to either three times your maximum datagram size, or
64 KB, whichever is larger. If that is not desirable, then we recommend configuring your
multicast applications to override the system default UDP send buffer size.</p>

<p>It is a good idea during the execution of this test for the network hardware
administration team to monitor switch CPU usage. We have seen cases where switches that
handle multicast in hardware still overload the switch CPU when high-rate multicast is
used. For example, we saw one user of Cisco hardware enable an ACL, with the result that
the CPU had to examine each multicast packet. This left his Cisco switch at 90% CPU
utilization even though he was only using about half of the gigabit bandwidth. It is
always better to discover this kind of CPU loading early, rather than on the "go-live"
day.</p>

<p>Be sure to run the test a second time, switching the roles of sender and receiver, and
remember to use a different multicast address for that second run.</p>

<p>It is beyond the scope of this simple document to attempt to fully diagnose and
describe the treatments of various multicast networking maladies. Networking routers and
switches are too diverse. However, you can find a wealth of general information in our <a
href="http://www.29west.com/docs/THPM/thpm.html#SETTING-KERNEL-UDP-BUFFER-LIMITS"
target="_top">THPM document</a>. If you suspect that your network infrastructure is not
able to handle high-speed multicast traffic, there is a very good chance that it is
simply a matter of switch and router configuration. We have found that network
administrators, working with the network hardware's support team, are usually successful
at enabling the proper hardware multicast routing parameters. It sometimes requires a bit
of patience and digging, but the scaling advantages of multicast are well worth the
effort.</p>
